# MiniTalk
This project is all about Creating a Communication program in the Form of a client and Server
  **The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
      • The client takes two parameters:
        ◦ The server PID.
        ◦ The string to send.
      • The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
          Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
      • The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think
          it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
      • Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without
          needing to restart.
      • The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using
          UNIX signals.
      • You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
